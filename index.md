My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I am passionate about human-factors engineering and design. This interest has led me to lead and manage teams from 50-120+ people to create and implement solutions that are thoughtful, innovative, and drive productivity.
