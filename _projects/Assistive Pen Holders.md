In Fall 2023 I designed a pen holder in Fusion360 for children with motor disabilities to stabilize writing as requested by a family local to my University. My design eliminated the need for a screwdriver to change the pen that existing solutions had, thus promoting independence and ease of use. The increased surface area helps provide grip control.

For this project, I learned features such as Section Analysis to verify that my threads were within tolerance of the selected screw. I also used the assembly features to demonstrate the use of the product before manufacturing with a Pursa 3D Printer with PLA for the lightweight versitility. The bright colors selected are for students that are low-vision to provide a bright contrast.

The family I partnered with for this project gave the pen holders to their local school.
