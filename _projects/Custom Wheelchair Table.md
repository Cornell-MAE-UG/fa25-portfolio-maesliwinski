In Fall 2024, I recieved a request from Finger Lakes Independence Center to make a custom table that interfaces with a custom wheelchair. My design focuses on using low-cost, lightweight materials, such as acrylic and allumnium extrusions, so that the user can push away the chair with minimum effort based on his condition.

The final result differs from the designed version as my team and I made quick iterations in order to deliver the project by the promised date. One of these changes was including washers under the bolts that secure the acrylic table top to prevent the stress fracture of the table top and secure it into place without an epoxy.
