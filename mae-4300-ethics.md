  <h1>Ethical Analysis: Boeing 737 MAX Crisis</h1>
  <div class="project-meta">
    MAE 4300 – Engineers and Society
  </div>

  <div class="pill-card pill-card--green">
    <h2>Overview of the Case</h2>
    <p>
      The Boeing 737 MAX crisis is a modern example of a large-scale engineering
      ethics failure. While the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System
      (MCAS) was the immediate technical cause, a holistic ethical analysis
      shows a far more complex breakdown involving individual decision-making,
      organizational culture, and regulatory structures at Boeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tragedy was not caused by a single flawed component or one negligent
      engineer, but by a systemic failure in how safety, accountability, and
      professional responsibility were balanced against cost, schedule, and
      competitive pressure.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pill-card pill-card--purple">
    <h2>Technical Decisions and Ethical Obligations</h2>
    <p>
      To compete with Airbus’s A320neo while keeping the 737 product line
      attractive, Boeing introduced MCAS to compensate for altered flight
      characteristics caused by larger engines. To avoid costly pilot
      retraining, MCAS was implemented using input from a single angle-of-attack
      sensor and without explicit pilot awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This design created a single point of failure in a safety-critical
      system and conflicted with engineers’ obligation to hold public safety
      paramount, as emphasized in codes of ethics such as the NSPE. While
      economic constraints are unavoidable in practice, ethical standards
      require that safety margins never be compromised, especially where
      failure can lead to loss of life.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pill-card pill-card--blue">
    <h2>Organizational Culture and Regulatory Structure</h2>
    <p>
      After the crashes, Boeing’s early communications tended to emphasize
      pilot error and procedural misunderstandings rather than acknowledging
      system-level design flaws. This response prioritized corporate reputation
      and legal exposure over transparency and public trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the company, engineers operated within a hierarchical structure
      where raising safety concerns could threaten job security or professional
      standing. Information silos limited system-level visibility, and
      regulatory delegation by the FAA blurred lines of accountability. Meeting
      minimum compliance standards came to feel “ethically sufficient”, even
      when deeper risks remained.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pill-card pill-card--green">
    <h2>Constraints on Engineers – and Their Limits</h2>
    <p>
      The case illustrates how practical constraints—schedule pressure, cost
      targets, corporate hierarchies, and delegated regulation—can erode
      ethical ideals in daily engineering practice. These constraints help
      explain how poor choices were made, but they do not excuse the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technical competence in aerospace requires robust validation, clear
      failure-mode analysis, and explicit recognition that software like MCAS
      can be safety-critical. Failing to treat it as such was a major
      contributor to the disaster.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pill-card pill-card--purple">
    <h2>Recommendations and Lessons for Engineers</h2>
    <p>
      Preventing similar crises requires action at multiple levels:
      engineers need training and support networks that empower ethical
      decision-making under pressure; organizations must cultivate cultures
      where raising safety concerns is rewarded rather than suppressed; and
      regulators must limit over-delegation and strengthen certification
      standards for safety-critical software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Independent safety review mechanisms with real authority and international
      coordination can help ensure that investments in safety are not treated as
      competitive disadvantages.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pill-card pill-card--blue">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The Boeing 737 MAX crisis shows that engineering ethics is not only about
      individual morality; it is about the design of technical, organizational,
      and regulatory systems. When cost, schedule, and competitiveness override
      safety, the resulting failures threaten public trust in engineering and
      infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      For practicing engineers, this case is a reminder that public safety is a
      core professional obligation. Upholding that principle requires technical
      expertise and also the courage to challenge systems that do not prioritize
      safety.
